# PathQuick - Chart Your Fastest Adventure! ðŸš€

Welcome to PathQuick, the ultimate guide to uncovering the quickest routes between! Whether you're a virtual road tripper or a logistical mastermind, PQ is here to deliver blazing-fast route calculations and seamless navigation.

## What Is PathQuick?

PathQuick is more than a piece of softwareâ€”it's your trusty digital cartographer. With its cutting-edge algorithms, PQ scours the labyrinth of roads connecting the landmarks and delivers routes with precision and efficiency.

## Why PathQuick Stands Out?

PathQuick isn't just about getting you from Point A to Point B; itâ€™s about doing so with flair and finesse. We've poured our love for problem-solving and optimization into this project to ensure:

Speed: Responses so quick, youâ€™ll think we have a crystal ball.

Flexibility: Love XML? Adore JSON? Weâ€™ve got you covered.

Accuracy with Balance: Real-world problems often demand compromises, and PQâ€™s heuristics ensure a near-perfect routeâ€”always within 10% of the shortest path.

## How Does It Work?

1. Give It a Quest:
    - Feed PathQuick the IDs of your starting and ending landmarks.

2. Sit Back and Relax:
    - Our REST API takes over, conjuring up the optimal path in the blink of an eye.

3. Revel in the Results:
    - PQ doesnâ€™t just deliver the travel time; it narrates the story of your journey through an ordered list of landmarks. XML or JSON? Your wish is our command.

## Behind The Scenes Magic

PathQuick is fueled by the raw computational power of C++, honed to perfection for speed and reliability. It wields algorithms that have been meticulously designed to navigate massive datasets, crunching through colossal .csv files with ease.

But we didnâ€™t stop there! PQ also includes a robust data validation tool to ensure every connection is rock-solid. Bidirectional roads? Fully connected graph? Weâ€™ve checked it all so you donâ€™t have to.

Go forth, chart your fastest adventure, and rememberâ€”all roads lead to PathQuick! ðŸŒŸ

## How To Use PathQuick?

PathQuick is available on both macOS and Windows.

To benefit from PathQuick's algorithm and pathfinding, you just need to perform few steps.

1. **Obtain the project source**

**Clone the repository**:

- Open your terminal
- Clone this repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-3-quickest-path-team-6`
- Type `cd 2024-2025-project-3-quickest-path-team-6` to get into the project's directory
- Type `cd Src` to get into the source folder

**Get the source code via a release**:

- Get the latest release [here](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-3-quickest-path-team-6/releases)
- Download the `.zip` file
