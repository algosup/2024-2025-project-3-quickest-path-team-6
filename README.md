# PathQuick - Chart Your Fastest Adventure Across the USA! ðŸš€

Welcome to PathQuick, the ultimate guide to uncovering the quickest routes between landmarks in the vast and diverse United States! Whether you're a virtual road tripper or a logistical mastermind, PQ is here to deliver blazing-fast route calculations and seamless navigation.

## What Is PathQuick?

PathQuick is more than a piece of softwareâ€”it's your trusty digital cartographer. With its cutting-edge algorithms, PQ scours the labyrinth of roads connecting the USAâ€™s landmarks and delivers routes with precision and efficiency.

## Why PathQuick Stands Out ?

PathQuick isn't just about getting you from Point A to Point B; itâ€™s about doing so with flair and finesse. We've poured our love for problem-solving and optimization into this project to ensure:

Speed: Responses so quick, youâ€™ll think we have a crystal ball.

Flexibility: Love XML? Adore JSON? Weâ€™ve got you covered.

Accuracy with Balance: Real-world problems often demand compromises, and PQâ€™s heuristics ensure a near-perfect routeâ€”always within 10% of the shortest path.

## How Does It Work?

1. Give It a Quest: 
    - Feed PathQuick the IDs of your starting and ending landmarks.

2. Sit Back and Relax: 
    - Our REST API takes over, conjuring up the optimal path in the blink of an eye.

3. Revel in the Results: 
    - PQ doesnâ€™t just deliver the travel time; it narrates the story of your journey through an ordered list of landmarks. XML or JSON? Your wish is our command.

## Behind the Scenes Magic

PathQuick is fueled by the raw computational power of C++, honed to perfection for speed and reliability. It wields algorithms that have been meticulously designed to navigate massive datasets, crunching through the colossal USA-roads.csv with ease.

But we didnâ€™t stop there! PQ also includes a robust data validation tool to ensure every connection is rock-solid. Bidirectional roads? Fully connected graph? Weâ€™ve checked it all so you donâ€™t have to.

Go forth, chart your fastest adventure, and rememberâ€”all roads lead to PathQuick! ðŸŒŸ
