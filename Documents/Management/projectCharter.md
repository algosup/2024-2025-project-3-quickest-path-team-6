# Project Description

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an algorithm<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> to find the quickest path between two landmarks in the United States. The response time of the algorithm has to be as quick as possible, with an error range of 10% more than the time needed for the actual quickest path.

## Project Goals

Goals have been set for this project which are:

- Creating an algorithm to find the quickest past between two landmarks
- The algorithm has to be as quick as possible
- The identified path can be at most 10% longer than the actual quickest path time
- We have to use the provided data
