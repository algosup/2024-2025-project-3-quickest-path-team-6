This week was full of progress, and we managed to finally finish the project following all the requirements.

## Accomplishment

    - The program is now complete, with all the required features, and with other features that we added for a better experience.
- **Program portability:**
    - The program is fully usable on MacOS and Windows.

## Challenges

- **Mac and Windows compatibility:**
    - Because of the differences between these two OSs, we had difficulties making the program compatible for these two.
- **Algorithm optimization:**
    - Making another algorithm from scratch was difficult with only the theory.

## Plan For Next Week

- Make and complete the presentation for the jury by the end of the week. 

## Conclusion

We succeeded to complete the program with everything we thought of implementing in it. Now we only have to present our project. We are confident about it but we know that we have to focus as much as we can to succeed.
