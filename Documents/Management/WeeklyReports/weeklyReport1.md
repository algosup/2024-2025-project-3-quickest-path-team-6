# Weekly Report 1

## Overview

This first week has been dedicated to analyzing the requirements and starting the project.

## Accomplishment

- **Specifications documents:**
    - The team made a great first progress to define the project
- **Code started:**
    - Our software engineers started to work on the algorithm

## Challenges

- **Understanding the requirements:**
    - A misunderstanding of the requirements could lead to a project that does not follow the client's needs
- **New technologies:**
    - Because we have to use technologies that we are not familiar with, we have to go through the learning process, thus taking us time other than progressing on the code

## Plan For Next Week

- Finish the functional specifications
- Most documents will have to be almost finished
- Put some effort into the progress of the code by other team members than the software engineers

## Conclusion

We started well on the project with great progress on documents. Some team members seem a bit lost, but on the next week we will clarify information or help the ones in need.
