# Weekly Report 2

## Overview

This second week, we achieved to get a working REST API and an algorithm. The interface for the project is also finished.

## Accomplishment

- **Code progress:**
    - We have a reassuring progress on the program

## Challenges

- **Absence of team members**
    - Some team members were absent, which slowed the progress of some documents
- **Including needed libraries**
    - We needed to include libraries to our program, which were difficult to make them work on different OS. But we succeed by doing some modifications on those libraries.

## Plan For Next Week

- Merge the REST API with the algorithm.
- Optimize the algorithm for 1sec response time.
- Finish functional and technical specifications.

## Conclusion

The progress on our program is going faster than expected, while the progress on some documents has been slowed because of some team members being absent. But still the team members are reassured of what we have done already.
