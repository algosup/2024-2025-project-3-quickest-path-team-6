- **Documents completion:**
    - Most documents have been completed.

## Challenges

- **Mac and Windows compatibility:**
    - Because of the differences between these two OSs, we had difficulties making the program compatible for these two.
- **Algorithm optimization:**
    - We struggle to find a way to optimize the algorithm, but we are still trying possible ways to do it such as multithreading.

## Plan For Next Week

- Optimize the algorithm to meet the requirements.
- Finalize the server and client programs.

## Conclusion

This week has been important for the advancement of document completion and software development. Next week we will be more focussed on research and optimization.
